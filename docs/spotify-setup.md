# ðŸŽµ Spotify Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

Your fitness app now supports Spotify integration, allowing users to:

- Connect their Spotify accounts
- Browse their playlists, featured playlists, and workout-specific playlists
- Control music playback during workouts
- Get music recommendations based on workout intensity

## ðŸ”‘ Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Spotify API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=ee3227dbc4c84716b60f43e4c3074b82
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=c5f2ebacc0ed42dea68b7077f0ddc4bb

# For development with ngrok (update with your actual ngrok URL):
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/spotify/callback

# For production:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/spotify/callback
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start with ngrok

1. **Authenticate ngrok** (one-time setup):

   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Start ngrok tunnel**:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. **Copy your HTTPS URL** from ngrok output (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)

4. **Update your .env file** with the ngrok URL:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/api/spotify/callback
   ```

5. **Add the same URL to Spotify App settings** in the redirect URIs

## ðŸ”§ Spotify App Setup

### 1. Create a Spotify App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Create App"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **App Name:** Your Fitness App
   - **App Description:** Fitness app with music integration
   - **Redirect URIs:**
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/callback` (development)
     - `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/spotify/callback` (production)
   - **APIs Used:** Web API

### 2. Get Your Credentials

1. After creating the app, go to Settings
2. Copy the **Client ID** â†’ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
3. Click "View client secret" and copy â†’ `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

### 3. Configure Redirect URIs

Make sure to add both development and production URLs:

- `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/spotify/callback` (development with ngrok)
- `https://localhost:3000/api/spotify/callback` (if using HTTPS locally)
- `https://your-actual-vercel-domain.vercel.app/api/spotify/callback` (production)

**Note:** Spotify requires HTTPS for redirect URIs. For local development, use ngrok or set up HTTPS certificates.

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema Updates

The User model has been extended with Spotify fields:

```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields

  // Spotify integration
  spotifyAccessToken  String?
  spotifyRefreshToken String?

}
```

**Run this to update your database:**

```bash
